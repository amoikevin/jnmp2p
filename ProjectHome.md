The Java Network Event Model framework for P2P applications aims to make development of p2p Java applications a breeze. JNMP2P provides an event based network programming model which is easy to use.
Users do not have to worry about the schematics of connection between two computers. It disjoins application design from the connection between them.
The same code can be run on both machines, it eliminates the need to develop different code for sender and receiver.
The communications between the devices is through a messaging system, which triggers events which can be handled by user-defined methods thus enabling Rapid Application development. Whether it be a chat program or a network sharing application, this is the way P2P applications should be developed. It could revolutionize the way you program. Just include the jnmp2p library and you're ready to experience its complete functionality.

If you liked the framework or have any questions or comments drop me a line at the jnmp2p google group (jnmp2p forum) or just email me at mani dot subodh at gmail dot com.
